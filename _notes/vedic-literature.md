It is presumed that the Rig Veda was composed while the Aryans were still in the Punjab. Vedic Literature comprises of four literary productions:

1. The Brahamans

2. The Upanishads

3. The Aranyakas

4. The Samhitas or Vedas


Vedic Literature had grown up in course of time and was really handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. Hence these are called Shruti (to hear). The most important of Vedic Literature are Vedas. Vedas are called Apaurasheya i.e. not created by man but God-gifted and Nitya i.e. existing in all eternity.


There are four Vedas-Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Atharva Veda. The first three Vedas are jointly called Vedatrayii.e. trio of Vedas.


Of the four Vedas, the Rig Veda (Collection of lyrics) is the oldest text in the world, and therefore, is also known as 'the first testament of mankind'. The Rig Veda contains 1028 hymns and 10,580 verses, divided into 10 mandalas. Six mandalas (from 2nd to 7th) are called Gotra/Vamsha Mandalas (Kula Granth). The 1st and 10th mandalas are said to have been added later. The 10th mandala contains the famous Purushasukta which explains the 4 Varas - Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. The hymns of Rig Veda were recited by Hotri.


The Yajur Veda (book of sacrificial prayers) is a ritual veda. Its hymns were recited by Adhvaryus, It is divided into two parts-Krishna Yajur Veda and Shukla Yajur Veda. In contrast to the first two which are in verse entirely, this one is in both verse and prose.


The Sama Veda (book of chants) had 1549 verses. All verses (excluding 75) were taken from the Rig Veda.


The hymns of the Sama Veda were recited by Udgatri. This Veda is important for Indian music.


The Atharva Veda (book of magical formulae), the fourth and the last one, contains charms and spells to ward off evils and diseases. For a very long time it was not included in the category of the Vedas. The Brahmansexplain the hymns of the Vedas. They are written in prose and ritualistic in nature. Brahma means 'sacrifice'. The various sacrifices and rituals have been elaborately discussed in the Brahamanas.Â 


The word Aranya means 'the forest'. The 'forest texts' were called Aranyaka, because they were written mainly for the hermits and the students living in jungles. The Aranyaka are the concluding portions of the Brahamanas.


The Upanishadas are philosophical texts. They are generally called Vedanta, as they came towards the end of the Veda. There are 108 Upanishadas. Vrihadaranyaka is the oldest Upanishada.

# About SpaceMan
I always wanted a Site where I can share notes and write blogs, But I didn't had any deep technical knowledge of Coding so I choose Jekyll to serve my purpose. Jekyll is Great for a blog and I like it a lot. I looked for a lot of theme but no themes had the feeling I was looking for , then I stumbled upon this theme Named **Enjoyment-work** which felt great and the feeling I wanted to feel. I also liked this theme because I found it somewhat similar to [Gwern.net](gwern.net) style, so I used it.

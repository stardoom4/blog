# Why and how I created this site.

# Why
**Why** did I start this **Personal Site**? I have a very different reason for this question. 
As I am a person who don't talk about his problems and thoughts to his father , I wanted to write it somewhere. Keeping a **Diary** is a great option ,but it won't last for a very long time unlike A blog or a digital garden where your thoughts will be on Internet until There is an **Zombie apocalypse**.

**Earlier** I was thinking about starting an Astronomy Wiki , but as there are many wikis and sources for that like **Wikipedia** and nasa.gov so, I left that idea. Though I created one wiki hosted at **Miraheze**. Then , I got an idea of creating a blog which I created at **[Substack](Substack.com)** (you can find it [here](https://herrspaceman.substack.com/)). It been a some time since I posted an article. **Then** I started to hunt some [Static Site Generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) , surprisingly I found **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** which is a Great tool if you want to create a blog and it can be hosted on **GitHub Pages** for **Free**. And it has Tons of themes which I will be mentioning in this Page. Upon Searching I found A [A digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) which was the best I found at that time. Upon looking for more I found [Enjoyment Work](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work) which this site is using. As I am a Mobile user ( **I have a Desktop Setup but due to some problem which I created, It doesn't work now.**) I used termux to Install Jekyll then edit it and then host it on GitHub but that Failed for **Enjoyment Work** as There wasn't a version of **Nokogiri** made for **Android** . That was the stopping point for me for a small time. Then after some time I started again but this time I learnt how to use **Netlify** and **GitHub** Correctly. This time I successfully Created and hosted for **Free** in Netlify.
